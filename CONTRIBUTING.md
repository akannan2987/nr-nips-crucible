# Terminal 1 — FastAPI (auto-reload) on a side port
cd backend && .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — React dev server, proxying /api to the backend above
cd client && VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- **Features**: `feature/descriptive-name`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/bug-description`
- **Documentation**: `docs/what-changed`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/what-refactored`

### 2. Make Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the backend test suite (contract-parity + unit tests)
cd backend && .venv/bin/pytest

# Run the app locally and smoke-test all modules:
# - Upload chemicals via Excel / SDF
# - Create samples
# - Add screening & toxicology data
# - Bulk operations
# - API endpoints (/api/stats, /api/chemicals, ...)
```

### 4. Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add bulk export functionality"
```

See [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines) below.

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Pre-Push Checklist (Before Pushing to Develop)

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The `develop` branch is the shared integration branch. Follow this checklist **every time** before pushing to avoid breaking the deployment or leaking sensitive files.

### 🔒 Step 1: Verify No Sensitive Files Are Staged

SSL certificates, private keys, and database files must **never** be committed.

```bash
# Check what's staged for commit
git status

# Look for ANY of these — they should NOT appear:
#   certs/          *.key    *.crt    *.pem    *.cer
#   data/           .env     .env.local

# Double-check staged files explicitly
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -iE '\.(key|crt|pem|cer|p12|pfx)$|certs/|data/|\.env'
# ✅ This command should return NOTHING. If it returns files, unstage them:
# git reset HEAD <file>
```

### 🧪 Step 2: Test the Application Locally

```bash
# Option A: Quick dev test
cd backend && .venv/bin/pytest        # backend tests must pass
cd ../client && npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000 and verify:
#   - Dashboard loads with stats
#   - Chemical upload works
#   - No console errors in browser DevTools

# Option B: Full container test (recommended before pushing)
./container-py.sh build
./container-py.sh start-ssl

# Verify HTTPS endpoint responds
curl --noproxy '*' -k -s https://localhost:49160/api/stats
# ✅ Should return JSON with chemicals/samples/screening/toxicology counts

# Check container logs for errors
podman logs --tail 20 crucible-py
# ✅ Should show uvicorn running with no errors

# Clean up after testing
./container-py.sh stop
```

### 📋 Step 3: Verify the Build Succeeds

```bash
# Build the production frontend
cd client && npm run build
# ✅ Should complete without errors

# Build the container image
./container-py.sh build
# ✅ Should show "Image built successfully"
```

### 🔍 Step 4: Review Your Changes

```bash
# See what files changed
git --no-pager diff --stat

# Review actual code changes (look for debug code, console.logs, etc.)
git --no-pager diff

# If changes are already staged:
git --no-pager diff --cached
```

**Remove before committing:**
- `console.log()` debugging statements
- Hardcoded localhost URLs (use relative paths or environment variables)
- Commented-out code blocks
- Temporary test files

### ✅ Step 5: Verify .gitignore Is Intact

```bash
# Ensure .gitignore still protects sensitive files
cat .gitignore | grep -E 'certs|key|crt|pem|data'
# ✅ Should show: certs/, *.key, *.crt, *.pem, data/

# Verify no tracked files should be ignored
git ls-files -i --exclude-standard
# ✅ Should return NOTHING
```

### 📝 Step 6: Follow Commit Message Conventions

```bash
# Use conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat(chemicals): add bulk export to CSV"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle duplicate chemical IDs"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update HTTPS setup instructions"

# For multiple changes, use descriptive body:
git commit -m "feat(upload): add SDF file format support

Add parser for SDF chemical structure files.
Includes mol_block extraction and validation.

Closes #42"
```

### 🚀 Step 7: Push to Develop

```bash
# Pull latest changes from develop first (avoid conflicts)
git pull origin develop

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them and test again (Steps 2-3)

# Push your changes
git push origin develop
```

### 📌 Step 8: Post-Push Verification

```bash
# SSH into the server and verify the deployment
ssh <your-user>@<vm-hostname>

cd /path/to/crucible
git pull origin develop

# Rebuild and restart
./container-py.sh rebuild
./container-py.sh start-ssl

# Verify it's working
curl --noproxy '*' -k -s https://localhost:49160/api/stats

# Check application in browser
# https://<vm-hostname>:49160
```

### 🛑 Quick Reference — DO NOT Push If:

| Check | Command | Expected |
|-------|---------|----------|
| No certs/keys staged | `git diff --cached --name-only \| grep -iE '\.(key\|crt\|pem)'` | Empty output |
| No data files staged | `git diff --cached --name-only \| grep 'data/'` | Empty output |
| Backend tests pass | `cd backend && .venv/bin/pytest` | All green |
| Build succeeds | `cd client && npm run build` | No errors |
| Container starts | `./container-py.sh build && ./container-py.sh start-ssl` | "Image built successfully" |
| API responds | `curl -k -s https://localhost:49160/api/stats` | Valid JSON |
| No debug code | `grep -rn 'console.log' client/src/` | Review & remove |
| .gitignore intact | `cat .gitignore \| grep certs` | `certs/` present |

## Promoting Changes Across Branches

`develop`, `beta`, and `master` form a **linear promotion chain**. To move a change up the
chain **while keeping the identical commit SHA on every branch**, promote by **fast-forward** —
never with GitHub's *Merge / Squash / Rebase and merge* buttons for `beta`/`master`, because
each of those mints a **new** SHA and causes `ahead/behind` divergence.

> 💡 A branch keeps the same SHA as another **only** when it is advanced by a fast-forward
> (the ref pointer moves to the exact same commit — no new commit is created). GitHub has no
> "fast-forward merge" button, so this promotion is done from the CLI.

### Prerequisites

- A local `develop` that tracks the remote:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git switch develop            # first time: git switch -c develop origin/develop
  ```
- `beta` and `master` are **fast-forwardable** from `develop` (they carry no commits of their
  own). If they diverge, realign once (see below) and fast-forward promotion works again.
- Direct pushes to `beta`/`master` are allowed — branch protection with *"Require a pull
  request"* will reject the direct fast-forward pushes.

### Standard flow — you are on local `develop`

```bash
# 1. Commit your change on develop — this is the single SHA that lands on all three branches
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(scope): describe the change"

# 2. Push develop AND fast-forward beta + master to that SAME commit (one command)
git push origin develop develop:beta develop:master
```

`develop:beta` / `develop:master` move those remote refs onto develop's exact commit, so
`develop`, `beta`, and `master` all end up on the **identical SHA**.

Explicit, safety-checked variant (`--ff-only` errors instead of creating a new SHA if a branch
cannot be fast-forwarded):

```bash
git push origin develop
git switch beta   && git merge --ff-only develop && git push origin beta
git switch master && git merge --ff-only beta    && git push origin master
git switch develop
```

### Verify all three match

```bash
git fetch origin
for b in develop beta master; do echo "$b -> $(git rev-parse --short origin/$b)"; done
# ✅ all three print the SAME short SHA
```

### Keep your local branches in sync

After promoting, your local `master` (and any local `beta`) is simply **behind** its remote by
the commit(s) you just pushed — a clean **fast-forward**, *not* a divergence. That is the payoff
of promoting by fast-forward instead of a merge/rebase button. Bring them up to date:

```bash
git fetch origin
git branch -f master origin/master      # fast-forward local master without checking it out
# git branch -f beta origin/beta        # repeat if you keep a local beta
```

Or, when the branch is checked out:

```bash
git switch master
git pull --ff-only origin master        # refuses (instead of merging) if it ever diverged
git switch develop
```

> `git branch -f <branch> origin/<branch>` fast-forwards safely **only** when the local branch is
> an **ancestor** of the remote — true right after a clean promotion (`git branch -vv` shows
> `behind N`). If it ever shows `ahead N, behind M`, that is real divergence — use
> *Realigning a diverged branch* below instead.

### Realigning a diverged branch (one-time fix)

If `git branch -vv` shows `ahead N, behind M`, or the branches show different SHAs for
identical content, collapse them onto one commit. This example points `develop` and `beta` at
`master`'s commit (so the protected `master` is not force-pushed):

```bash
git fetch origin
git push --force-with-lease origin origin/master:develop origin/master:beta
git switch master && git reset --hard origin/master     # sync local master
```

> ⚠️ `--force-with-lease` rewrites the shared `develop`/`beta` refs — coordinate with the team,
> and note branch protection may block it. It is content-safe **only** when all branches already
> hold identical content.

### ❌ What breaks SHA parity (avoid)

- GitHub **"Rebase and merge" / "Squash and merge" / "Create a merge commit"** to promote to `beta`/`master`.
- Committing directly on `beta` or `master`.
- `git pull` on a branch that was rebase/squash-merged on the remote — use `git reset --hard origin/<branch>` instead.

> Use PRs (any merge strategy) **only** for `feature/* → develop`. Promote `develop → beta → master` by fast-forward.

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/React

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use destructuring where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused

**Example:**

```javascript
// Good
const getChemicals = async ({ page = 1, limit = 20 }) => {
  const response = await api.get('/chemicals', { params: { page, limit } });
  return response.data;
};

// Avoid
function getChemicals(page, limit) {
  page = page || 1;
  limit = limit || 20;
  var response = api.get('/chemicals', { params: { page: page, limit: limit } });
  return response.data;
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use meaningful prop names
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript types

**Example:**

```jsx
// Good
const ChemicalCard = ({ chemical, onDelete }) => {
  const handleDelete = () => onDelete(chemical.id);
  
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3>{chemical.name}</h3>
      <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Avoid large components with multiple responsibilities
```

### Backend — Python (FastAPI, `backend/`)

- Type hints everywhere; docstrings on public functions
- Pydantic models for request bodies (kept lenient — see `backend/app/schemas.py`)
- **API parity is the contract**: any change to a route must keep the response
  shape identical to `API.md` and pass `backend/tests/` (`.venv/bin/pytest`)
- Keep router files thin; business logic lives in `store.py` or `utils/`
- Prefer clear, idiomatic code over clever one-liners; explain advanced
  constructs (DI, sessions, validators) with a short comment on first use

**Example:**

```python
# Good — thin router, lenient body, {"error": ...} shape on failure
@router.post("", status_code=201)
def add_chemical(body: ChemicalIn, db: Session = Depends(get_db)) -> dict[str, Any]:
    if find_row(db, Chemical, "chemical_id", body.chemical_id):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Chemical ID already exists")
    chemical = {"id": str(uuid.uuid4()), **body.merged_dict(), "created_at": now_iso()}
    insert_doc(db, Chemical, chemical)
    return {"message": "Chemical added successfully", "chemical_id": chemical["chemical_id"]}
```

### CSS/Tailwind

- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Use responsive design classes
- Follow mobile-first approach

**Example:**

```jsx
// Good
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
  <Card />
</div>

// Avoid inline styles
<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr' }}>
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Add a route function to the relevant file in `backend/app/routers/`
2. Keep the router thin — put logic in `store.py` or `utils/`
3. Add an API function in `client/src/services/api.js`
4. Document it in `API.md` and add a test in `backend/tests/`
5. Test with cURL or the OpenAPI docs at `/docs`

### Adding a New UI Component

1. Create component in `client/src/components/`
2. Use Tailwind for styling
3. Add PropTypes or TypeScript
4. Import and use in page component
5. Test in different screen sizes

### Adding a New Page

1. Create page in `client/src/pages/`
2. Add route in `client/src/App.jsx`
3. Add navigation link
4. Update documentation

---

## Development Cleanup

After you're done developing or before switching to a different project, clean up your local environment.

### Quick Cleanup (Recommended)

Use the `uninstall.sh` script:

```bash
# Partial cleanup — removes container, image, cron, logs, keeps source code
./uninstall.sh --partial

# Preview what would be removed first
./uninstall.sh --dry-run
```

### Manual Cleanup

If you prefer to run steps individually:

```bash
# Stop the dev servers (if running): press Ctrl+C in their terminals

# Stop and remove container + image
./container-py.sh clean

# Remove monitoring cron job
crontab -l | grep -v 'monitor.sh' | crontab -
rm -f /tmp/crucible-monitor.log

# Free disk space
rm -rf client/node_modules/ backend/.venv/
rm -rf client/dist/
rm -rf certs/ data/
```

### Full Uninstall

```bash
# Removes everything including data and project directory
./uninstall.sh --full
```

See the [Uninstall & Cleanup guide](DEPLOYMENT.md#uninstall--cleanup) in the Deployment documentation for complete details.
